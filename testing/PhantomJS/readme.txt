Uses PhantomJS, a Javascript engine that drives headless
WebKit browsers, to do automated testing. Also makes use
of Selenium.

This can do load testing when used in conjuction with a 
cluster like hamming--multiple jobs can be submitted to 
nodes in the cluster. Or it can be used as a nagios-style
test script.
