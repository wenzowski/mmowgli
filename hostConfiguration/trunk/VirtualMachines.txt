Virtual Machines

I have configured a number of VMWare/ova virtual machines to run
MMOWGLI. Go to

https://movesinstitute.org/~mcgredo/VMs/mmowgliSingleHost.ova

To download the single-host, all-in-one server. On modern hardware
this should be good for several hundred users. The host is not
necessarily locked down for open internet access, and you may need
further configuration to ensure compliance with your site's 
security standards.

Has documentation on what's needed. There are also a number of
VMs for a multi-node setup for high volume.
