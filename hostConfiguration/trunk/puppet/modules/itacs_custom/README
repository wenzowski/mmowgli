This "module" extends facter facts.

managed_by:   looks for the presence of a file in /etc
              (/etc/.itacs_managed or /etc/.cs_managed) to determine whether a system is managed
              by ITACS or Cybersecurity.  The new field in the facter list 'managed_by' can be
              viewed directly in facter (facter -p) or in PuppetDB
              (select * from certname_facts where (name='managed_by' and value='ITACS managed') ).

mailserver:    tries to determine whether the mail server on the system is sendmail or postfix.
               The new file in the facter list is 'mailserver'

Only the puppet master needs to run this, the facter extensions to clients happens
automatically when they sync up.
